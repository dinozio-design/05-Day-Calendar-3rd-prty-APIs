this is my initial pseudo code:

start by:

// add html links to jQuery, DayJs, and Bootstrap 

// update top of the page to show day and time

// populate the page with full day blocks of one hour

// format each block name to yyyymmddHH and save the contents in local storage;

// us Bootstrap to set color and styles
    // must use if conditions to compare timeblock with time hour

// review and implement clicks and events for each timeblock
// save button to write into local storage

// all event displays must come from local storage
// properly implement use of fontawesome and googlefonts api
