# 05 - Work Day Scheduler | Third-Party APIs
### On-the-job ticket
<br>

## Description

In this week's Challenge! I modified starter code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. . This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

To achieve this task, I used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time.


## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
